#with O(n) time and constant space sorting is out nor can we keep 
#track of seen nor mark out expexted

#well, we can keep track of lowest int series seen so far. Namely, we
#want to see "1", otherwise the answer is simply 1.

#We can just ignore negative numbers. We may need to count how many 
#occurances of negative numbers weve seen (and 0) so we can get the len
#of the positive ints in the array

#Can we use the triangular number sum to help? If only ONE number was
#missing, of course. But multiple numbers could be missing and we are
#only interested in the lowest of these
#sum of ints * 2 = X * (X + 1), have to use quadratic formula, but A 
#and B are simplified so its just 
# (-1 + sqrt(1-4*(-sum)))/2

#We can then compare the actual sum to the expected sum of n numbers
#to see the difference... I dont know if this is going anywhere.
#This difference is then the SUM of the missing numbers

#it cant be a monotonic stack thing right? That wouldnt be O(n)

#Had to look it up. I dont love it. I did recognize that we could just 
#ignore 0 and negative numbers, that could have been the hint; If we 
#KNOW our list is then all positive numbers, we can "cheat" and use
#the sign bit of the input to store information about n nodes. Thus
#my instinct was correct, it CANT be done without n storage, but there
#is a way to sneak that storage in without it being "additional". 
#I think this solution is clever, but its absolutely not obvious and to
#ask someone to come up with this without a hint is kind of trash. 



# class Solution:
#     def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         #first pass: clear the negative numbers and zero. 
#         nums = [x for x in nums if x > 0]

#         #second pass: start marking found ints. This is the "clever"
#         #bit: the first missing int must be below n itself; if the list WASNT
#         #missing an int, then it must contain 1-n, so there is no room for numbers
#         #larger than n. A single number larger than the length of the list will imply
#         #there is a missing number. Also any double. But a larger number is of no further
#         #utility, we dont need to store info about it. We only need to store infor about
#         #numbers UNDER n, and heyâ€” now we have a data structure of len n to do so  
#         for num in nums:
#             if abs(num) <= len(nums): 
#                 nums[abs(num)-1] *= -1 if nums[abs(num)-1] > 0 else 1 

#         #Note this is destructive to the input, which is some bullshit. 
#         #Now I could just multiply these by minus one instead, which would 
#         #allow me to reverse the proccess later. I could have sorted the list in
#         #the beginning and only started this process with the positive half of the list
#         #too, thus also preserving the negative ints and zeros at the cost of a few
#         #pointers. 

#         missingno = len(nums) + 1
#         for n in range(len(nums)):
#             if nums[n] > 0:
#                 missingno = n + 1
#                 break
#         return missingno

              
        
        # print(int((-1 + math.sqrt(1-4*-90))/2))
