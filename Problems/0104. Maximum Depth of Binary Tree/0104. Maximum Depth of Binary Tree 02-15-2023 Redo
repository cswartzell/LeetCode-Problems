# 02-15-2023 Leetcode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/

#Wait, its BTree. We can do this with math. Oh... No right, we have
#to parse the tree. Its not in array form. BFS I guess

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
            
        next_level = [root]
        curr_level = []
        max_depth = 0
        while next_level:
            curr_level, next_level = next_level, []
            max_depth += 1
            while curr_level:
                curr_node = curr_level.pop()
                if curr_node.left:
                    next_level.append(curr_node.left)
                if curr_node.right:
                    next_level.append(curr_node.right)
        return max_depth
